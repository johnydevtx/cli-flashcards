# cli-flashcards
A command line application for the review of flashcards

The aim of this software is to provide a fast, powerfull, and full-featured application for the review of flashcards. Im basing it of the flashcard app mnemosyne (http://mnemosyne-proj.org/) and following the philosiphy of simplicity demonstrated by todo.txt (https://github.com/ginatrapani/todo.txt-cli). Im still in the very early stages of design.
